MyCloset, A Clothing Inventory & Profit Analytics Dashboard
An inventory management and analytics tool for tracking purchases, sales, and profit margins for clothing resale businesses.
Built with Python, Streamlit, and SQLite among other tools.

ABOUT:
This project was developed to manage and analyze my personal Depop(an online platform for selling mostly clothing) resale inventory.
Over time, I had accumulated 100s of clothing items, making it challenging to track purchase details, selling prices, and time spent in inventory.
There are many sellers that face the same struggles as me, some I have even met and spoke with in real life.
I designed this system to centralize all my inventory data in one place, where I can view and filter items by category, brand, size, etc.
Also integrated a Statistics Dashboard in order to create a better understanding on what products can generate the most revenue, as well as shortest time spent in store.
